This page contains the goal of this project with minimal requirements for the app, thoughts about some wishfull abilities. I also include a proejct planning and begin writing the readme file.

key goals will be:
- clover recognition in an image, finding a spot with a clover (or more than one).
- should look like a classic image detection algorithm making a box at a position containing one clover.
- training and testing on images with one plant at the time.
- traing and testing to find a 4-clover if the images is detected as containing a 4-clover

good abilities and key koncept will be:
- to find areas in a picture where there is good chances of finding a clover, and more precise good chances of finding a 4-clover. The 4-clover is the main goal.
- making an app that shows live feed of camera and detecting arease with high chances of finding a 4-clover


Setting up this procjet will need the following
- Setting clear goal to succes on th image detection part
- Setting good hypothesis in the different part of the goals
- Getting data to train and test on
- Defining some good neural networks to train
- Getting theory about neural network and training
- writing the applicationtion to test and asses how good the model is at prediction on the different parts of the image detection...
- Getting theory about making an app
